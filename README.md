# **MNIST Neural Network**

The MNIST Neural Network project is a Python application that implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It leverages the power of deep learning to accurately identify digits ranging from 0 to 9.

## **Key Features:**

Training and Testing: Train the neural network model on the MNIST dataset to learn the patterns and features of handwritten digits. Evaluate the model's performance through testing to measure accuracy and loss.

Prediction: Utilize the trained model to predict the digit present in input images. The neural network provides real-time predictions for handwritten digits, enabling seamless recognition.

Graphical Visualization: Visualize the training and testing process with graphical plots of accuracy and loss over epochs. These visualizations provide insights into the model's learning progress and performance.

## **Technologies Used:**

Python: The primary programming language used for developing the neural network model and application logic.
TensorFlow/Keras: TensorFlow and the Keras API are employed to construct and train the convolutional neural network model.
OpenCV: OpenCV is utilized for image processing tasks, including loading and preprocessing input images.
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is used for generating graphical plots to visualize model performance during training and testing.

## **Usage:**

Training the Model: Train the neural network model by executing the provided Python script. This script loads the MNIST dataset, constructs the CNN architecture, and trains the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Testing the Model: Evaluate the trained model's performance by testing it on a separate set of MNIST images. The testing process measures the model's accuracy in correctly classifying digits.

Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on custom input images containing handwritten digits. The model outputs the predicted digit for each input image.
